🌱 URAMix – Smart Waste to Wealth Platform

URAMix is a reward-based waste management web application that encourages households to segregate waste, reduces landfills, promotes clean India, and supports affordable organic farming.

🇮🇳 Problem Statement

India generates nearly 62 million tonnes of waste every year, and more than 70% of it ends up in landfills.

Major Issues:

People dispose waste improperly because:

Dustbins are not collected daily

Irregular garbage collection

No motivation or reward system

Organic waste gets mixed with plastic waste

Landfills cause:

Soil pollution

Water contamination

Health hazards

Organic manure is expensive, making natural farming unaffordable for many farmers

💡 Solution – URAMix

URAMix provides a technology-driven and incentive-based solution:

Households segregate waste (organic & inorganic)

Organic waste is converted into organic manure

Inorganic waste is sent for recycling

Users earn credits for daily participation
